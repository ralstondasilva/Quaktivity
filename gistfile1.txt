Plethora .NET Coding Challenge
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple desktop application which monitors and informs the user of the latest global earthquake activity, as well as potentially affected cities.

Data

The United States Geological Survey provides a selection of data feeds that provide up-to-date earthquake data through an API. The data is in a derivative of JSON called GeoJSON.

OpenGeoCode provides a CSV-formatted document listing world cities and their coordinates: World Cities

Solution

Using the .NET Framework, write a desktop application which monitors and displays, in list format, the following details about ongoing earthquake activity:

Earthquake date/time
Earthquake magnitude
Earthquake coordinates
A comma-separated list of names of the three cities positioned closest to the earthquake location
When the program is first loaded, it should retrieve and display any earthquake activity from the past hour. The program should then continue to monitor and display any additional earthquake activity without additional input from the user, until the program is closed by the user.

Deliverables

Please put your solution into a project on github and send the link for your project. Your github project should include:

Your source code files
Any resource files required by your application
A README file that contains:
instructions for building and utilizing your application
a list of dependencies or references used in your solution
